    "Banks have a huge volume of applicants applying for loans. Some of the applicants do not have credit history or some might have very light credit score. It doesn't mean that lending money to them is highly risky so we should reject all of these applicants. This project uses data about personal loan. Our goal was to develop a model that could step by step explain the results of the model we built and what impact on the likelihood of the case falling into one of the binary categories (loans paid-off and charged). This model predict the 68 % of loan default and would be useful for the banks to make the best decision."
