    "LendingClub was the first peer-to-peer lender to register its offerings as securities with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and to offer loan trading on a secondary market. At its height, LendingClub was the world's largest peer-to-peer lending platform. \n",
    "LendingClub offers the unique combination of being a well-capitalized, publicly traded U.S. corporation (LendingClub Corporation), and a national bank (LendingClub Bank), along with a digital consumer lending arm that has originated over $63 billion in loans since inception. Today, LendingClub partner with dozens of asset managers, hedge funds and other investment vehicles as well as over 60 U.S. banks who have previously purchased personal loans."

    "Banks have a huge volume of applicants applying for loans. Some of the applicants do not have credit history or some  might have very light credit score. It doesn't mean that lending money to them is highly risky so we should reject all of these applicants. This project uses data about personal loan. Our goal was to develop a model that could step by step explain the results of the model we built and  what impact on the likelihood of the case falling into one of the binary categories (loans paid-off and charged). This model predict the 64 % of loan default and would be useful for the banks to make the best decision."
